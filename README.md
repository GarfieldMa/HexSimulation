# HexSimulation

A Python implementation of an algorithm to obtain a phase dia-
gram of two-dimensional interacting lattice bosons based on cluster meanfield
theory in physics. The algorithm is developed by [Dr. Pu GONG](http://www.physics.hku.hk/~wangyao/people.html), a Postdoc
at Department of Physics, The University of Hong Kong and implemented by 
[Rutian MA](https://github.com/GarfieldMa), an Undergraduate Computer Science student in
the University of Hong Kong.
